French election explained in five charts
French voters are choosing a new president - amid considerable political uncertainty in Europe and the world following the British vote for Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as US leader. 
So who are the candidates and what are the issues likely to decide this election?
Latest opinion polls show Ms Le Pen is ahead of the other four candidates in the first round - though a long way short of 50% - and is therefore likely to get through to the run-off. 
In 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen got through to the second round, but lost to Jacques Chirac.
Prosecutors have launched a full judicial inquiry into the affair but he has survived an attempt within his party to replace him as candidate.
One of the overriding issues facing French voters is unemployment - with at least one in four people aged under 25 unemployed.
The problem of reducing unemployment will now fall to his successor.  
The French economy is the second-biggest in the eurozone - but its recovery from the financial crisis of 2008 has been slow.  
One of Mr Hollande's key policies was a new labour law, intended to help boost the economy by giving firms greater freedom to increase regular working hours, reduce pay and lay off workers.  
But measures were watered down to get the bill through and the hoped-for improvements in the economy have not yet materialised.
All the leading candidates have argued that deep changes are needed in the French economy. 
Security and immigration are also high on the agenda in this election. 
More than 320 people have died in terror attacks in France since January 2015. 
Tens of thousands of migrants have arrived in France as a result of the crisis which began in 2015, largely as a result of people fleeing the conflicts in Syria and Iraq.
