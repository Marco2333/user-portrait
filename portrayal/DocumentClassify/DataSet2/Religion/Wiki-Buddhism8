Idols of deity and icons have been a part of the historic practice, and Buddhist texts such as the 11th-century Sadanamala, wherein a devotee visualizes and identifies himself or herself with the imagined deity as part of meditation.[266][267] This has been particularly popular in Vajrayana meditative traditions, but also found in Mahayana and Theravada traditions, particularly in temples and with Buddha image.[268]
