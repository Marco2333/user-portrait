Buddha added a new focus and interpretation, particularly through the Four Dhyanas methodology,[237] in which mindfulness is maintained.[238][222] Further, the focus of meditation and the underlying theory of liberation guiding the meditation has been different in Buddhism.[225][239][240] For example, states Bronkhorst, the verse 4.4.23 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad with its "become calm, subdued, quiet, patiently enduring, concentrated, one sees soul in oneself" is most probably a meditative state.[241] The Buddhist discussion of meditation is without the concept of soul and the discussion criticizes both the ascetic meditation of Jainism and the "real self, soul" meditation of Hinduism.[242]
