The collapse of the Soviet Union itself, in 1991, was seen by many Islamists, including Bin Laden, as the defeat of a superpower at the hands of Islam. Concerning the $6 billion in aid given by the US and Pakistan's military training and intelligence support to the mujahideen,[164] bin Laden wrote: "[T]he US has no mentionable role" in "the collapse of the Soviet UnionÂ ... rather the credit goes to God and the mujahidin" of Afghanistan.[165]
