Morocco profile - Media
The broadcast media are either dominated by the state or reflect the official line. However, the private press has succeeded in breaking taboos over some sensitive topics, including allegations of high-level corruption. 
Paris-based Reporters Without Borders notes that "religion, the king and the monarchy in general, the country and territorial integrity cannot be questioned." 
The Press Law provides for prison terms. The editor of Al-Massae daily was jailed for one year in 2011 for stories he had written about corruption and the activities of the security services. Media watchdogs said the move was a step backwards for press freedom. 
The government owns, or has a stake in, RTM and 2M, Morocco's main TV networks. Satellite dishes are widely used, giving access to French and pan-Arab stations. 
There were 16.5 million internet users by June 2012 (Internetworldstats.com). There is no policy of widespread site filtering. Bloggers generally avoid sensitive topics, such as Western Sahara and the royal family.
