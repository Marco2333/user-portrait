Zuckerberg dismisses presidential bid rumours
Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg says he has no plans to run for president of the United States.
Speculation that Mr Zuckerberg might run for president was fuelled when he made political comments and announced a tour of US states.
The 32-year-old would be old enough to stand for president in 2020.
He has also softened his approach to religion, describing it as "very important", in a Christmas post. 
Mr Zuckerberg had previously described himself as an atheist, which might have limited his appeal with some US citizens.
Presidential candidates typically tour US states to drum up support.
Buzzfeed News said Mr Zuckerberg had "not immediately responded" to further questions about possible political ambitions.
