Wakefield nightclub Religion criticised by bishop
A new Wakefield nightclub has been accused by a bishop of "trivialising" people's faith by naming club nights Mass, Resurrection and Salvation.
The club, Religion, also sells cocktails with names like Angel Wings.
The Bishop of Wakefield, the Right Reverend Stephen Platten, said: "For people who are religious, those words are seen as key issues to their life."
Leisure 99, which owns the nightclub, said: "The name of the club nights aren't linked to any specific faith."
The club, which opened last Friday, advertises Monday Mass, offering "massive offers" on alcoholic drinks.
Its Resurrection night promises to "bring your Friday back to life" and Saturday is billed as "Salvation - the answer to your prayers".
The company said in a statement: "The definition of the word religion is a pursuit or interest followed with great devotion, which is what partygoers in the city are doing.
"We chose the term Resurrection for a Friday night, because the night-time economy's suffering and we're hoping to revive and revitalise it, as its definition suggests. 
"The same is true of Salvation, and the word Mass was chosen because it's a massive Monday night of massive music."
Bishop Platten said: "If any other aspect of people's lives was taken and trivialised in this way I think people would be upset.
"In particular, in this case, it affects Christian people."
