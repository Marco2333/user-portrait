Among other measures, voters were asked to approve an overhaul of the country's legislative process, namely the Senate -- one of Italy's two chambers of parliament -- which would see its membership cut from 315 to 100, reducing much of its power. Outgoing Prime Minister Matteo Renzi lobbied hard for the changes, arguing they would benefit the country and help push his much-needed economic policies through Italy's bureaucratic red tape.

"Luigi Di Maio is an obvious name," said Scarpetta, referring to the 30-year-old vice president of the Chamber of Deputies -- the other chamber of Italy's parliament."But remember this is also a movement that makes a big deal of transparency and accountability, selecting candidates by online surveys," he said. "I'm inclined to think they may do the same again."
