Aberdeen agriculture college to be closed
An Aberdeen agriculture college is to be closed as part of a cost-cutting drive.
Aberdeen College has announced that its Clinterty Centre, at Bucksburn, will shut next summer.
There will be no job losses, and the 200 students will be allowed to complete their studies.
Animal-care and horticulture courses will move to the nearby Scottish Agriculture College (SAC) campus at Craibstone.
