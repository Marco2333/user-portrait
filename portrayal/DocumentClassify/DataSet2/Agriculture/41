Wales Act carries seeds of own destruction, says Rawlings
Another Wales Bill could come as soon as the next UK parliament in 2021, a leading constitutional expert has said.
Devolution principles set out by the Silk Commission had been "chipped away" through the process of passing the law.
The UK Government's Wales Office declined to comment.
The legislation gives the assembly new powers over income tax, transport, energy, and its own elections.
The act also moves to a "reserved powers" model, by which power is assumed to be devolved in all matters except those specifically retained by Westminster and Whitehall. 
"You see a backward-looking approach by Whitehall trying to base the new system on an old set of powers. 
"You see an elite and closed form of constitution making - you see an excessive fragmentation of powers in the arrangement that's delivered. 
"In a sense there is a basic lack of constitutional vision that has run all the way through the last 20-25 years of Welsh devolution. 
"Because of that lack of constitutional vision in the legislation, we have to keep revisiting (the settlement)." 
Mr Rawlings said the Silk Commission's attempt to outline a set of principles for Welsh devolution had been "chipped away at through deals, through technicalities and through machinations in the background". 
"So that some very high hopes that we had right at the beginning of the process leading up to the Wales Act have in so many ways been disappointed," he said. 
The professor said he also thought there would be pressure for a separate Welsh legal jurisdiction, and Brexit would have an impact through different policies on matters currently handled at EU level, such as agriculture. 
He argued for "moving Wales closer to the kind of situation that we see in Scotland", which had a reserved powers model with fewer exceptions.
