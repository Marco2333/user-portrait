Suriname country profile
Suriname, once known as Dutch Guiana, is one of South America's smallest countries. It enjoys a relatively high standard of living but also faces serious political and economic challenges.
Since independence from the Netherlands in 1975 Suriname has endured coups and a civil war. Suriname is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the Americas. 
Most of its people are descended from African slaves and Indian and Javanese indentured labourers brought over by the Dutch to work in agriculture. Most political parties are ethnically based. 
Gold, oil and agriculture are key economic sectors. Bauxite mining has gone into decline. Efforts have been made to diversify the economy. 
President: Desi Bouterse
Former military leader Desi Bouterse was elected to his second term as president in July 2015 after his National Democratic Party (NDP) won a slim majority in parliament. 
He was elected to his first five-year term in 2010 after the Mega Combination alliance, which included the NDP, won the legislative election in May that year. 
He had ruled the former Dutch colony twice before as a result of military coups, from 1980 to 1987 and again in 1990. 
In 1999, a Dutch court tried him in absentia and sentenced him to 11 years in prison for smuggling 400kg of cocaine. 
In April 2012, Suriname's parliament passed a controversial amnesty law granting him immunity for alleged violations committed under his earlier military rule and for which he was due to face trial.
State-run broadcasters operate alongside private radio and TV stations.
By the end of 2015, about 41% of the population was online.
