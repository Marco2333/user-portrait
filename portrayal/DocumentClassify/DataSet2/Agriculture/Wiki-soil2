The most influential factors in stabilizing soil fertility are the soil colloids, clay and humus. Soil colloids behave as repositories of nutrients and moisture and so act to buffer the variations of soil solution ions and moisture.[42] The contribution of soil colloids to soil nutrition is out of proportion to their part of the soil. Colloids act to store nutrients that might otherwise be leached from the soil or to release those ions in response to changes of soil pH, and so, make them available to plants.[43]
