"Cowboy" as an adjective for "reckless" developed in the 1920s.[6] "Cowboy" is sometimes used today in a derogatory sense to describe someone who is reckless or ignores potential risks, irresponsible or who heedlessly handles a sensitive or dangerous task.[128] TIME Magazine referred to President George W. Bush's foreign policy as "Cowboy diplomacy",[129] and Bush has been described in the press, particularly in Europe, as a "cowboy".[130]
