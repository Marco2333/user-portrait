Thousands to attend Royal Manx Agricultural Show
More than 20,000 people are expected to attend the "highlight" of the Isle of Man's farming calendar.
The Royal Manx Agricultural Show will take place on Friday and Saturday at Knockaloe Farm in Patrick.
The two day annual showcase was first held on the island in 1858. It moved from Sulby, its home for 20 years, in 2010.
Show secretary Christine Pain said there will be about 2,000 exhibitors taking part.
She added: "This show is a chance to see the very best of island life - exhibitions include anything from a jar of jam to a prize bull."
The show field will be open from 09:00 BST until 17:00 on both days with the main livestock judging taking place on Saturday.
