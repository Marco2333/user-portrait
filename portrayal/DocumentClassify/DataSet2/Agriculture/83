Michelle O'Neill: Agriculture Minister's 'export mission' to China
Northern Ireland's agriculture minister will make a return trip to China this weekend as efforts intensify to secure a market for Northern Ireland pork. 
Michelle O'Neill will meet with Chinese officials with responsibility for food standards. 
China is set to become the world's largest consumer of pork, surpassing the European Union by 2022. 
The minister said she would use the visit to build on an "important relationship" between both countries.
Inspectors from China made two trips to pork plants in Northern Ireland in April as part of the approval process.
Exports
Mrs O'Neill said: "I  am hopeful my visit will maintain momentum on the approval process."
Northern Ireland already exports dairy products and animal hides to China. 
As well as a market for pork, it is hoped there could be opportunities for beef and chicken exports in the future. 
The minister will also promote Northern Ireland's agri-food industry during the week-long trip.
The minister will travel on Sunday in what will be her third visit to China.
