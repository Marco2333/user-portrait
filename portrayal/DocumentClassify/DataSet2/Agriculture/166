Strabane jobs announced by Department of Agriculture
Strabane is to get 40 new civil service jobs.
Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill has confirmed that her department will open an office in the County Tyrone town.
It will provide a 'one-stop shop' service for farmers to do business transactions with the department. 
The minister said the office would have 40 staff and would open within the next two years.  
"I am convinced that Strabane is a location well placed to provide the full range of services to farmers in the surrounding area, and I will be working to ensure that we get these services up and running as soon as we are able," Ms O'Neill said.
"Once an office has been provided in Strabane, it will complete the full roll-out of DARD direct offices across the north."
DARD direct offices have been established in Enniskillen, Coleraine, Dungannon, Newry, Mallusk, Magherafelt, Downpatrick, Armagh, and Omagh, with offices in Newtownards and Ballymena opening shortly.
