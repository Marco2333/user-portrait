Prince Philip opens Wiltshire military barracks
The Duke of Edinburgh has officially opened a new military barracks in Wiltshire, which has been named in his honour.
Prince Philip, aged 94, toured the recently refurbished MoD Lyneham in Wiltshire.
The former airbase site has been reopened as a Â£230m military training facility.
It is now the new regimental headquarters of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME). 
As he opened the barracks, the former Navy officer and Colonel-in-Chief of the REME, said: "I hope you realise what you're about to see now is the world's most experienced plaque unveiler in action." 
Prince Philip toured a truck engine simulator, a remote controlled bomb disposal robot and saw a classic Land Rover once owned by the late Queen Mother.
Major Rebecca Macklin, of the newly formed 8 Training Battalion REME, said: "He had a lot of interest in our training programme and the facilities we have.
"It's really the best you can get anywhere in the world.
"The new training battalion is fantastic because it brings together two different units from Arborfield and Bordon under one roof."
