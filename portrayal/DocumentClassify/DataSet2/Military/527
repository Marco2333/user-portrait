It comes as the nation's parliament convenes its annual meeting, amid ongoing tensions in the South China Sea and acrimony over South Korea's deployment of a missile defense system. 1.3% of China's GDPFu Ying, the spokeswoman for the National People's Congress (NPC), which begins its 11-day session Sunday, said the proposed budget "based on defense needs as well as the national economy" accounted for 1.3% of China's GDP."We have to guard against external forces from getting involved in our territorial disputes," she said in response to a CNN question. "The strengthening of China's (military) capabilities help preserve peace and stability in the region, not the opposite."That's a 10% increase over the cap on defense spending imposed by a budget deal that Congress passed six years ago.The NPC and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an advisory body, meet each March for what's known in China as the "two sessions." The event, which sees some 3,000 NPC delegates flock to the capital, is long on pageantry and short on legislative deliberation; while some voting takes place, the Communist Party's proposals are always approved. It's often described as a rubber stamp parliament.How will it get spent?Yvonne Chiu, an assistant professor in politics and public administration at Hong Kong University, said the key thing to watch for is how the defense budget gets spent -- Beijing typically gives few details. She said that China is likely to emphasize developing naval capacity.China's military build-up has unsettled its neighbors and Washington, particularly as Beijing has taken a more robust stance in territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Large-scale land reclamation by China has transformed sandbars into islands equipped with airstrips, ports and missiles.CNN Money's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.
