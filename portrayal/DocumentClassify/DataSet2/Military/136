South West emergency services to train on military base
Police, fire and ambulance services from the South West are to train alongside soldiers in responding to emergencies, the BBC has learnt.
About 1,000 emergency staff will be involved in exercises lasting two weeks on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire.
The operation has been designed to prepare crews for major outbreaks of disorder such as rioting or a terrorist attack.
Senior officers stressed it was not in response to any specific threat.

Devon and Cornwall Police Assistant Chief Constable Paul Netherton said: "This scenario could test us in any situation. 
"It could be a terrorist attack or a serious incident such as a train crash."
The regions taking part
The military, police and crime commissioners, chief constables and heads of the fire and ambulance services will observe the operation.
Chief Fire Officer for Devon and Somerset Lee Howell said: "This exercise will test us in a very extreme scenario that is going to be very challenging.
"It's increasingly important we work together not just at an operational level but at a tactical level to make sure the public and crews are safe."
The training operation begins on 25 October.
