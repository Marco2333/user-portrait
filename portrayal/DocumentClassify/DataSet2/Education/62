'Trojan Horse' governor appeals against school ban
A former chairman of governors has launched an appeal to overturn a ban imposed on him over an alleged "Trojan Horse" Muslim takeover plot in schools. 
Tahir Alam was banned from involvement in schools by the Department for Education (DfE) in September 2015. 
Officials ruled he had engaged in conduct aimed at undermining fundamental British values.
Mr Alam, the former head of governors for Park View Education Trust, has always denied any wrongdoing.
A specialist tribunal began analysing appeal evidence on Wednesday.

Lawyers representing the Education Secretary Justine Greening said the ban was "appropriate" and should not be "revoked." 
Martin Chamberlain QC said Mr Alam had "espoused a conservative, intolerant and narrow faith-based ideology" and "believed that the practices associated with this ideology should be imposed on state-funded non-faith schools with predominantly Muslim pupils." 
Lawyers claim evidence will show:
Under the ban, Mr Alam is prohibited from holding governor roles in all independent schools, academies, free schools, and maintained schools.
Mr Alam argued that investigators had a "pre-conceived agenda" and had reached "unfair or inaccurate" conclusions.
The hearing in London is expected to last several days.
