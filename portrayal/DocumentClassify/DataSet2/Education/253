St Bees boarding school to reopen with Chinese link
A 400-year-old boarding school in Cumbria which closed after student numbers dwindled is to reopen with a link to a Chinese educational group.
St Bees School, which had been struggling since the 2008 economic collapse, shut its doors in 2015.
Its new board of trustees has formed a partnership with Shenzhen International - which runs a college near Hong Kong offering UK educational qualifications.
The independent day and boarding school will reopen from September 2018.
In a statement, the trustees said the two institutions shared "a clear and unified vision of educating global leaders for the internationally mobile world". 
It added: "The Old St Beghian community [a society of former pupils and staff] has provided essential support and encouragement in helping us to reach this point, and we look forward to developing a new cohort of OSBs in the future."
