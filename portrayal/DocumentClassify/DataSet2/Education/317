Reality Check: Your questions answered about education and research
 Lots of you have got in touch with BBC Radio 4's PM programme about what a possible exit from the EU might mean for education and research. We've answered some of your questions below. 
This report included EU and non-EU students, but they pay different rates of tuition fees. 
Students from EU-member states who come to study in the UK pay the same university fees as British students. 
Tuition fees for non-EU students are much higher.
In 2014-15, there were close to 440,000 overseas students in the UK, or 19% of the total number of students. 
According to figures by the Higher Statistics Agency, British and EU students together contributed £10.5bn in tuition fees to the income of British higher education institutions. 
We do not have any figures for the contribution of EU students from outside the UK.  
Non-EU students paid a total of £4.2bn in student course fees - so that is 13% of overall income.
If the UK voted to leave the EU, nothing should change immediately as all the current arrangements would stay in place for at least the first two years of negotiation. 
So it's unlikely that Erasmus students in the UK or British students taking part in the Erasmus programme in other countries would be affected. 
We do not have concrete figures on how many UK students are currently studying in Erasmus participating countries - but we do know that in 2013-14 more than 15,000 students from the UK took part in it. 
As such, a UK exit from the European Union should not affect the country's involvement with ESA.
