Two sexually abused women urge parents to talk to children
Two women who were sexually abused at primary school by the same teacher are urging parents to talk to their own children about protecting themselves. 
Kerrie Ann Jones and Kate Taylor have waived their right to anonymity because they want sex abuse to become less of a taboo subject.  
They were sexually abused aged six at a school in Doncaster, South Yorkshire.
The women held the first of what is hoped to be a series of public meetings for families in the town on Monday.

The first meeting was held in Finningley Village Hall.
The teacher, who abused the pair about 30 years ago, was later jailed and is now on the sex offenders register.
Ms Jones, 35, said: "When it happened to me I think I knew it was wrong because nothing like that happened at home.
"For 10 years it was in my head but reality struck when I was 17 years old and it wasn't just my imagination."
"Parents are wary about talking to their children we need to give them the tools to speak to their children at home."
Kate Taylor, 37, said abusers rely on the fact "no one will take about it".
"All you need to do is just talk to them [your children]", she added.
Pauline Hargreaves, a Doncaster school nurse, said: "This is crucial, this is the way we get our message out there."
The local authority and education service were "really keen to pilot this", she said.
School nurses in Doncaster are to talk to many Year 1 pupils on the subject, she added.
The NSPCC estimates 1 in 20 children in the UK have been sexually abused and a third of those do not tell anyone.
