Isle of Portland Aldridge Community Academy jobs to be axed
Dozens of jobs are set to be axed at a troubled academy school that has recently been rated inadequate by Ofsted and seen its principal resign.
It is understood a minimum of 45 jobs need to go due to budget savings at Isle of Portland Aldridge Community Academy (IPACA).
In a statement, Kate Shaw, chair of the IPACA governing body, said: "Our current budget position means we need to make some bold decisions to achieve significant savings and put the academy on a sound financial footing. 
"This is necessary to be able to continue to make the necessary rapid improvement parents and children expect."
Hannah Packham, from the National Union of Teachers, confirmed 45 full-time equivalent posts would be axed, which she described as "very significant".
She added the union was working with the employer in a bid to mitigate the losses at the school, which has 1,112 pupils aged from four to 19.
The Department of Education said it was aware the school started consulting staff over restructuring proposals last week. 
It added it was working closely with the school "to ensure it has the support it needs to give each of its pupils the excellent education they deserve".
The school had been due to join multi-academy trust Aldridge Education in January.
