Bangor: Vomiting and diarrhoea bug closes school
A Bangor special school has been closed for two days due to a vomiting and diarrhoea bug.
The school principal said a number of staff and pupils at the school had had "sudden onset vomiting and diarrhoea".
Clifton Special School was closed on Monday and Tuesday as a precautionary measure so it could be "deep cleaned". It is due to re-open on Wednesday.
The 130-pupil school educates pupils aged 3-19 with severe learning difficulties, and has over 70 staff.
The BBC understands the school principal, Stephanie Anderson, informed parents over the weekend of the reasons for the planned closure. 
"The school decided to close on Monday 6 March as a precautionary measure and remained closed on Tuesday 7 March so that extensive clean could be carried out," she said.
"The cleaning is now complete and the school will re-open on Wednesday 8 March."
She also thanked parents for their support and understanding.  
"The safety and wellbeing of the staff and pupils at Clifton Special School is of paramount importance," she said.
"We have been working with the Education Authority and Public Health Agency on this matter."
