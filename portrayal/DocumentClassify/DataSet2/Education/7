Vote backs Welsh stream education at Brecon High School
A majority of councillors voted in favour of retaining a Welsh-medium stream at a Powys school on Tuesday.
But 32 members of full council opposed the plans, with eight in favour. 
The vote was taken as an indication of the full council's views but it was not a final decision. That rests with the cabinet which meets on 14 March.
A council report said low pupil numbers and the "need to ensure robust linguistic progression and appropriate curriculum choice for Welsh-medium pupils" were the reasons for the recommendation.
The council plans to centralise Welsh-medium education for mid and south Powys in Builth Wells High School, which is a 40 mile round trip.
A consultation has been carried out on the plans, with staff, parents and pupils raising a number of concerns.
Among them were pupils missing out on extra-curricular activities, such as after school clubs and music lessons, due to having to travel to Builth Wells for Welsh-medium education.
