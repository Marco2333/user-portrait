Guernsey's education committee asked to resign
Guernsey's education ministers have been ask to resign in a row over the use of 11-plus exams on the island.
Seven deputies have filed a motion of no confidence in the States' Education, Sport and Culture committee.
A letter detailing their concerns cites "confusion" and "inconsistency" within the committee and asks members to either step down or seek a fresh mandate.
The committee's president, Paul Le Pelley, was unavailable for comment.
Those who filed the motion believe the committee would struggle to formulate a plan to see selection end as the majority of its members support it.
The letter says: "While committees, from time to time, receive directions from the States which are counter to their own recommendations, it is very rare for them to be directed to do something in which they have expressed no faith, and to which they have demonstrated sustained, uncompromising opposition."
The committee has been given a week stand down before an official motion of no confidence is put forward.
