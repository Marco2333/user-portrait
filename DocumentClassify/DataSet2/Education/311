'Eyesore' building sold to University of Bristol
A derelict building in the centre of Bristol which has often been described as an "eyesore" has finally been sold.
The former Royal Mail sorting office in Cattle Market Road, which was owned by Bristol City Council, has been disused for about 20 years.
The land, to the east of Bristol Temple Meads railway station, will now be used to house the University of Bristol's "digital innovation hub".
It is believed the council will make up to Â£16m from the sale.
A meeting of the council's cabinet agreed to sell the the authority's freehold interest in the Cattle Market Road site and nearby land which is not required for the Bristol Arena project.
Elected mayor, Marvin Rees, said the derelict land has been a "blight" on the city for too long.
"This deal could offer an exceptional opportunity to create a flourishing and inclusive home of digital excellence, innovation, education and industry. 
"It could also bring forward more quickly jobs and opportunities for our citizens from other sites in the area."
