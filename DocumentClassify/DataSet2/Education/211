BBC National Orchestra to perform Malala speech premiere
A musical world premiere set to the words of Malala Yousafzai will be performed in Cardiff to mark International Women's Day.
Speak Out, by Kate Whitley, will be performed by the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales alongside the children's choir Cor y Cwm.  
The concert takes place at BBC Hoddinott Hall at 19:30 GMT.
Ms Yousafzai, 19, said: "I am honoured and excited that my speech inspired a composer to set it to music.
"As the speech is a call to raise our voices, it makes me very happy that it will be sung by a large choir, that so many voices will rise to share the message of education for all."
Ms Whitley said she felt "very lucky" to have been asked to "write a piece for such an important day celebrating women around the world".
