Online curriculum advice for teachers 'necessary', says education boss
The boss of Scotland's national education body has told MSPs that a large online document for teachers about curriculum reforms was necessary.
Education Scotland's Bill Maxwell said large parts of the 20,000-page guidance was an "appropriate" at the time.
Concern about the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) advice was raised last year by teacher unions.
They believed the document had served to overwhelm teachers with unnecessary and unclear guidance.
Mr Maxwell defended its publication as MSPs quizzed representatives of the Curriculum for Excellence board on how such a high volume of advice had been allowed to build up.
Asked by Labour MSP Johann Lamont whether the thousands of pages were necessary, he said: "Large parts of it were."
He explained to Holyrood's education committee: "I would argue much of it was an appropriate response at that point in time when it was requested, and served a useful purpose for a period of time and then has a natural timespan.
"For example, in the very early days we were modelling learner journeys before the new curriculum model existed, so there was some guidance about what new pathways through a senior phase curriculum that didn't at that point exist might look like."
He said such models "can disappear" as "more practical" real life examples emerge.
Mr Maxwell added: "I won't pretend every piece of advice we've ever put out has absolutely hit the mark."
