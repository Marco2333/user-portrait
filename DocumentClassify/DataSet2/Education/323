Welsh Assembly election: Lib Dems' education challenge
The Welsh Liberal Democrats have challenged rival parties to match their promise to protect education spending.
Leader Kirsty Williams claimed hers was the only party to make such a pledge ahead of the assembly election in May.
The Lib Dems aim to cut infant class sizes and give schools more money for pupils from a poorer background.    
Ms Williams said the Lib Dems had listened to parents' concerns and said it was time for other parties to "step up to the plate".
"If you value the importance of education, then we are the party for you," she said before visiting a school in Cardiff on Thursday.
"We recognise that education is vitally important to ensure everyone has a fair start in life, and so that we have a well-skilled economy.
"That is why we will ring-fence spending on education: both for schools and higher education."
