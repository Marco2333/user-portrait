Able pupils' progress 'stifled' in schools, says Estyn
More able children are not getting enough attention in Wales' education system, the schools watchdog has said.
Chief inspector of schools Meilyr Rowlands told AMs it was partly due to the "unintended consequences" of how schools' performance is measured.
Another Estyn witness said more able learners' progress had been "stifled". 
Ministers agreed they needed "to do more to push our most able students" and were introducing changes to raise standards "for all our young people".
Mr Rowlands said that schools focused on a performance measure which requires pupils to get five GCSEs at grade A*-C, including English or Welsh and maths.
That, he said, encouraged schools to focus on the borderline between C and D grades "and possibly not giving enough support for those who could get As and A*s".
"I don't think schools and the education system more generally have done enough," he said.
Claire Morgan, Strategic Director for Estyn, said the focus on particular performance indicators meant there is "some gaming, [and] early entry that hasn't helped to stretch the more able".
"I think this has stifled the progress of more able learners," she added.
A Welsh Government spokesman said ministers recognised "we need to do more to push our most able students to reach their full potential". 
The changes were intended to "raise standards and extend opportunities for all our young people no matter what their background", he added.
