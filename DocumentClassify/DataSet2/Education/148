Education Authority: Four outdoor residential activity centres to close
Half of the eight large outdoor residential activity centres run by the Education Authority (EA) are set to close next year.
It is hoped the move could save the EA around Â£1.5m.
The activity centres currently offer courses for young people and adults.
Delamont Outdoor Education Centre in Killyleagh, County Down, is due to close next March. Three others will shut in August 2017.
They are Bushmills Outdoor Education Centre in County Antrim, Ardnabannon Outdoor Education Centre in County Down and Killowen Outdoor Education Centre, also in County Down.
