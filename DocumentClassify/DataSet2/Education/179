Slough council regains control of education services
Slough education services currently run by a private firm are set to be brought back under council control.
The government initially ordered the services to be handed to an independent trust which is already managing the borough's children's social services.
The Department for Education (DfE) has now revoked the order, allowing the council to take back control.
The council's cabinet, meeting on Monday, is expected to agree the transfer of education support services, children's centres and the early years service back to the council when the Cambridge Education contract expires in October.
Councillor Sabia Hussain, commissioner for education and children's services, said: "Even though there is much left to do, we have turned a corner and I am confident that by working in partnership with the trust we will once again deliver quality services that children and young people in Slough quite rightly deserve."
Control of the borough's schools - including admissions, transport, catering, attendance, staffing and governor support - was handed to Cambridge Education in 2013 to give "greater value for money".
