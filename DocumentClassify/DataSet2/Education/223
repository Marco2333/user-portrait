Former Chilham school head faces indecent image charges
A former head of a Church of England primary school has been charged with possessing indecent images of children.
Richard Williams, 48, was suspended from Chilham St Mary's, near Canterbury, after his arrest and later quit.
Police have found no evidence any child at the school or any others Williams had been involved with had been affected, a council spokesman said.
He added the community was "very distressed" about the arrest.
"As soon as the chair of governors was informed of Mr Williams's arrest, immediate action was taken to safeguard the school's pupils," the spokesman said.
"Mr Williams was suspended, prevented from entering the school site and, following a meeting with the chair of governors and KCC's area education officer, he resigned with immediate effect."
No complaints have been received from parents, pupils or staff about Williams's conduct with children, he added.
Williams, of Alexander Drive, Faversham, is due to appear at Canterbury Magistrates' Court on 28 April.
