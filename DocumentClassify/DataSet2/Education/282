Teesside voters urged not to miss 'game-changing' election
A campaign is urging people to vote in a "game-changing" election for a newly created regional mayor.
The Tees Valley mayor will have responsibility for Hartlepool, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough and Darlington.
Combined Authority managing director Andrew Lewis said the public needed to be more aware of the new role's responsibilities.
It was "important everyone's voice is heard", he said.
The five councils had been working closely together for about 20 years, he said.
But now extra powers, responsibility and money had been devolved from central government it was "really important that those new powers are democratically accountable".
The new mayor will make decisions in areas such as transport, jobs, education, housing and investment.
Voters are being encouraged to make sure they are registered to vote on 4 May.
