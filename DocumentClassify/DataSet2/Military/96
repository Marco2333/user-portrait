Watchdog to probe trustees of 1st Knight Military Charity
The trustees of a military charity found selling Nazi-themed and anti-Islamic goods are to be investigated by a watchdog. 
Their conduct is one of a series of issues that will be examined by The Charity Commission in its inquiry into 1st Knight Military Charity. 
Andy Linihan also sold badges alluding to the shooting of suicide bombers. 
The programme revealed the charity was selling Nazi-themed T-shirts and hooded jumpers, some emblazoned with neo-Nazi emblems. 
Velcro badges, designed to be placed on uniforms or baseball caps, featured a picture of an assault rifle and the words '72 Virgins Express'. 
The Charity Commission has now outlined the issues that will be examined by the inquiry: 
Mr Linihan said he accepted the items filmed by the BBC were "products which ought not to be sold by the charity".
He added: "As a result of your visit, we have withdrawn the products from the shop and removed them from the internet."
