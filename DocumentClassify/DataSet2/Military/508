Controversial statementIn announcing the budget increase this year, National People's  Congress spokesperson Fu Ying noted that China lags far behind the US in military capacity, but reiterated the need to defend and "safeguard our sovereignty and interest and rights" and to preserve "peace and security in this region."Furthermore, a non-aggressive country that is only interested in self-defense would most likely not need blue-water capabilities or an overseas military base.Even as China needs to reassure the international community that it has no aggressive intentions, which it is trying to do with its modest military budget increase this year, it is caught in a bit of a bind.China seeks to become a major world power, and one of the hallmarks of such a status is blue-water capability and the ability to project military might globally; so to that end, it believes it must continue developing its military along all dimensions.At the same time, this goal has domestic implications. Another is that the military build-up serves to further promote nationalism at home, which is already used in many cases as a distraction for serious domestic problems in the economic, political, and social realms.China undoubtedly sees the populist, nationalist, and aggressive rhetoric coming from the current US president as an opportunity to step into the seeming gap in international leadership that has presented itself, and a muted military response such as this small budget increase is part of that strategy.But it masks bigger goals. China cannot help but want to continue to transform and enhance its military in its quest to become a major international power.This is, of course, a legitimate ambition, but military development necessarily poses more of a threat internationally, as well as fans the flames of nationalism at home, which may become difficult to contain, especially if an opportunity arises to test the military's new capabilities.Yvonne Chiu is an assistant professor at The University of Hong Kong specializing in China's military and diplomacy.
