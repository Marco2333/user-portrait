Red Arrows get Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo off to flying start
The Red Arrows have helped the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo get off to a spectacular start.
The RAF's aerobatics team streaked over Edinburgh Castle ahead of the tattoo performance on Saturday.
With the Royal Jordanian Honour Guard and band standing to attention, the jets painted the sky in their trademark red, white and blue smoke trails.
This year is the 67th tattoo and it is themed on Tunes of Glory, celebrating the Queen's 90th birthday.
The Royal Jordanian Army is playing a central role this year and the country's monarch, King Abdullah II, and his wife Queen Rani arrived for the latter part of the show.
In addition to the band, the Middle Eastern country's silent drill team and Circassian Guards will be performing at the tattoo.
Also appearing at the tattoo, which runs until 27 August, will be the New Zealand Army band, the Lochiel Marching Drill Team and the Imps motorcycle display team.
