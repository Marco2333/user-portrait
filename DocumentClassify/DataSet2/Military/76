Paraglider's 'near miss' with Airbus A400M military plane over Hampshire
A paraglider feared for her life during a near miss with a military transport aircraft, a report has said.
The woman, who has not been named, was operating a paramotor - a motorised paraglider - when she had a "very close encounter" with an Airbus A400M near Andover, Hampshire, in July, the UK Airprox Board (UKAB) said.
She told investigators "she thought she was going to die".
The UKAB assessed the incident as having the most serious degree of risk.
The woman, who was taking part in a training weekend with the British Paramotor Team at the time, "turned abruptly to the right" after spotting the aircraft, which was flown 600ft (183m) from her, the report said.
The A400M pilot, who was approaching Boscombe Down Airport in Wiltshire, said he did not take any avoidance action when he saw the woman as "it was quickly apparent" she would pass down the left hand-side of his aircraft.
Investigators concluded that both pilots "shared an equal responsibility for collision avoidance".
They added that "providence had played a major part" in the woman escaping unhurt.
A member of the board stated that there was a "very real risk" from the wake turbulence caused by the aircraft and concluded that "the paramotor pilot's concerns about the risk posed were justified".
