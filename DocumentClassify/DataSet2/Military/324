Four dogs who worked with the US military in Afghanistan have been awarded medals for their sacrifice and service to the United States.
The canines were given the K-9 Medal of Courage, and are the first to receive the honour created by welfare group the American Humane Association.
The medals were presented by top commanders at a ceremony at Capitol Hill in Washington.
All four dogs had saved humans' lives by smelling out explosives.
