Five lorry drivers hurt in A17 military truck crash
Five lorry drivers have been injured in a crash involving four military trucks and an HGV.
The collision happened at about 12:00 BST on the A17 Station Road at Swineshead Bridge near Boston.
Three men were airlifted to hospital with "serious injuries" while a woman and another man were taken by ambulance, Lincolnshire Police said.
The force said the military vehicles were being transported by civilians and not military personnel.
