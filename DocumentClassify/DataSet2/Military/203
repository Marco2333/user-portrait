Syria peace talks end on a positive note, says UN
Syrian peace talks have ended on a more positive note than previous meetings, according to the UN envoy for Syria. 
But the slow-moving discussions, which took place in Geneva and are the first in almost a year, still led to no major breakthroughs.  
"The train is ready, it's in the station, it's warming up its engine. It just needs an accelerator," said the UN's Staffan de Mistura. 
The Syrian government's delegation left without comment. 
Chief opposition negotiator Nasr al-Hariri said, "Although we are closing this round without clear results ... I can say this time was more positive.
"It was the first time we discussed in acceptable depth the future of Syria and the future of political transition in Syria," he continued. 
Russian representatives met both sides behind the scenes, according to Reuters news agency. 
Mr De Mistura said the UN-led talks had the support of key regional player Turkey, which supports the opposition, as well as Russia and Iran, who are Syrian allies.
He said, "[There are] people in Syria and outside who still believe there is a military option or a military solution. That is fantasy."
The parties have agreed to return to the negotiating table later in March to discuss four key issues: governance, a draft constitution, elections and counter-terrorism.
Counter-terrorism was added to the agenda at the insistence of President al-Assad's delegation, according to the UN. 
The Syrian government considers all rebels to be terrorists.
