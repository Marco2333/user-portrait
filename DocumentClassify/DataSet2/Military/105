Navy bids farewell to Lynx helicopter with flypast
The Royal Navy has said farewell to the Lynx helicopter with a flypast over southern England. 
It was a chance for fans to say goodbye to the maritime aircraft, which is being decommissioned after 41 years.
Four Mark 8 Lynxes toured military sites associated with the helicopter after departing from their Yeovilton base.
They flew over locations including Weston-super-Mare, Lyme Regis and Navy Command Headquarters in Portsmouth.
The Lynx, which will be decommissioned at the end of the month, was based at RNAS Portland in Dorset for over half of its service before moving to RNAS Yeovilton.
The British-made aircraft remains popular, with a Lynx Community celebrating the flypast in Weymouth and Portland. 
The Mark 8s flew over Glastonbury Tor, Rolls Royce Filton, Weston-Super-Mare helicopter museum, Devonport and Britannia Royal Naval College before following the coast to Lyme Regis. 
They also flew over their birthplace the Westland factory in Yeovil before visiting Portland, Lulworth, Sandbanks and Fleetlands, before reaching their eastern most point, the Isle of Dogs, and following the River Thames westwards through Middle Wallop, Boscombe Down and Compton Abbas.
