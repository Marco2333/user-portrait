UK military deaths in Iraq
The UK lost 179 servicemen and women during the campaign that followed the invasion of Iraq on 20 March 2003. 
Many of those who died were killed by roadside bombs or in clashes with insurgents while on patrol. Others died as a result of accidents, so-called "friendly fire" strikes, suicide or natural causes.
The six-year British military mission came to an end in April 2009.
The names and details of all the servicemen and women who died are included in the page below. 
Causes of death classed as "Other" include servicemen who died from natural causes, heatstroke, as a result of an accident and a soldier killed while clearing cluster bombs.
