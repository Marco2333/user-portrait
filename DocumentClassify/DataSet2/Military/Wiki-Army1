Sun Tzu's The Art of War remains one of China's Seven Military Classics, even though it is two thousand years old.[1] Since no political figure could exist without an army, measures were taken to ensure only the most capable leaders could control the armies.[2] Civil bureaucracies (士大夫) arose to control the productive power of the states, and their military power.[3]
