Street entertainment, street performance or "busking" are forms of performance that have been meeting the public's need for entertainment for centuries.[129] It was "an integral aspect of London's life", for example, when the city in the early 19th century was "filled with spectacle and diversion".[130] Minstrels or troubadours are part of the tradition. The art and practice of busking is still celebrated at annual busking festivals.[131]
