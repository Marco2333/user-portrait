BBC Asian Network apologises for tweet about blasphemy
The BBC has apologised after a tweet from the Asian Network account asked, "What is the right punishment for blasphemy?".
The tweet provoked criticism that the BBC appeared to be endorsing harsh restrictions on speech.
In an apology posted on Twitter, the network said it intended to debate concerns about blasphemy on social media in Pakistan.
"We never intended to imply that blasphemy should be punished," it said.
The post on Twitter was intended to publicise the station's Big Debate programme with presenter Shazia Awan. 
In her opening script, presenter Shazia Awan said: "Today I want to talk about blasphemy. What is the right punishment for blasphemy?"
Explaining the context of Facebook's visit to Pakistan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's call for a social media crackdown, she asked: "Is this the right way to handle blasphemy? Or do you think that freedom of speech should trump all else?"
Critics ranging from human rights campaigners to secularist organisations challenged the premise that it should carry any punishment.
In Pakistan, blasphemy - the act of insulting or showing lack of reverence for God or a religion - can carry the death penalty and those accused can face intense public anger. Britain abolished its blasphemy laws in 2008.
"We never intend to imply Blasphemy should be punished. Provocative question that got it wrong."
A BBC spokesperson said: "Asian Network's Big Debate asks difficult and provocative questions every day. 
"This programme was an engaging discussion on the subject of blasphemy, but we admit that the question could have been phrased better, as we have since made clear."
