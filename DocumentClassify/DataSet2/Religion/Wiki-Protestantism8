Several countries have established their national churches, linking the ecclesiastical structure with the state. Jurisdictions where a Protestant denomination has been established as a state religion include several Nordic countries; Denmark (including Greenland),[52] the Faroe Islands (its church being independent since 2007),[53] Iceland[54] and Norway[55][56][57] have established Evangelical Lutheran churches. Tuvalu has the only established church in Reformed tradition in the world, while Tongaâ€”in the Methodist tradition.[58] The Church of England is the officially established religious institution in England,[59][60][61] and also the Mother Church of the worldwide Anglican Communion.
