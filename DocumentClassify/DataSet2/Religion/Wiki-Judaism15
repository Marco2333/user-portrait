There are some movements that combine elements of Judaism with those of other religions. The most well-known of these is Messianic Judaism, a religious movement, which arose in the 1960s,[140][141][142][143] that incorporates elements of Judaism with the tenets of Christianity.[143][144][145][146][147] The movement states that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah, and generally that he is one of the Three Divine Persons,[148][149] and salvation is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one's savior.[150] Some members argue that Messianic Judaism is a sect of Judaism.[151] Jewish organizations of every denomination reject this, stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect, as it harbors identical creeds to that of Pauline Christianity.[152]
