A ruling by Europe's top court legalising a ban on wearing religious symbols in the workplace has been met by both support and anger online, with some speculating about what this could mean for hijabis at work.
The ruling was prompted by the case of a receptionist who was fired from security company G4S in Belgium for wearing a headscarf to work.
Some European countries have banned full-face veils in public spaces.
Ayesha told the BBC: "I'm an optometrist who meets patients all day. How does my covering or uncovering my hair affect my performance? And why should it cause any offence to others?"
And Tabassum emailed to say her head scarf would always come before a job.
"I am a top performer at my company and headscarf doesn't make difference to my talent, my skills, my performance or my work but then I could be kicked out from my job because I wear a scarf. If I have to choose between my head scarf and job, I will definitely choose my head scarf," she wrote.
John Phillips from Milton Keynes emailed the BBC to say why he was for the ruling.
"Finally, finally common sense has prevailed! A religion or religious belief is an individual - a personal - choice," he wrote.
"Religion, and/or it's observance should play no part whatsoever in public life. It should remain in the home and/or the relevant faith's house of worship."
Some drew attention to the ban extending to symbols from other faiths and people who chose to wear scarves for other reasons.
"Does this mean such companies will not be allowed to celebrate Christmas by decorating their offices," Ali emailed.
