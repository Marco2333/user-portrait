Inquiry into Brexit's impact on devolution launched
An inquiry into the impact of Brexit on devolution in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland is being launched by a Westminster committee.
The Lords' EU Committee will hear from academics, business leaders and politicians in Cardiff on 7 February.
It will also discuss which powers should be devolved when they are transferred from Brussels.
The UK as a whole voted for Brexit in June's referendum, as did England and Wales. 
However, poll results in Scotland and Northern Ireland showed a majority there wanted to remain part of the EU.   
On Friday, committee chairman Lord Boswell said this "presents challenges for the forthcoming Brexit negotiations".
"We want to get to the bottom of the effect of Brexit on the devolution settlement, and how the different views across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can all be fairly represented in the forthcoming negotiations," he said.
"We will explore issues including which powers returning to the UK from Brussels should be devolved, and the resources that the devolved institutions will need to take on these responsibilities."
