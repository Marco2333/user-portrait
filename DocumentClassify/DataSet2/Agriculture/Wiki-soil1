Soil is a major component of the Earth's ecosystem. The world's ecosystems are impacted in far-reaching ways by the processes carried out in the soil, from ozone depletion and global warming, to rainforest destruction and water pollution. Following the atmosphere, the soil is the next largest carbon reservoir on Earth, and it is potentially one of the most reactive to human disturbance[16] and climate change.[17] As the planet warms, soils will add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere due to its increased biological activity at higher temperatures. Thus, soil carbon losses likely have a large positive feedback response (amplification) to global warming,[18] although positive feedback has been questioned on the base of more recent knowledge on soil carbon turnover.[19]
