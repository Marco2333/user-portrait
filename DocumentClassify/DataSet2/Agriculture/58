Former Coate Agricultural Museum 'badly damaged' in fire
The former Coate Agricultural Museum has been badly damaged by fire.
Fire crews were called to Coate Water Park Lane, Swindon, early on Saturday following reports of the blaze.
Although the museum had been closed for some 40 years it is believed a number of artefacts stored in the building have been damaged.
One of the town's MPs, Conservative Robert Buckland, described the news as "dreadful" but said he was hopeful some of the items could be saved.
The South Swindon MP said he had visited the site earlier.
"One end of the barn looks particularly damaged but the other end, to the layman, looks intact and the roof appears ok," he said.
"I very much hope they [the borough council] can find some storage space for some of the agricultural machinery that was stored there and I fully support any attempts to salvage the exhibits."
Garry Perkins, Swindon Borough Council's cabinet member for the economy, skills and regeneration, said about a third of the building had gone.
He added he hoped many of the wooden items could be saved.
