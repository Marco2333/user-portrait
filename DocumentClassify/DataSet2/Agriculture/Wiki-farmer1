In the context of developing nations or other pre-industrial cultures, most farmers practice a meager subsistence agricultureâ€”a simple organic farming system employing crop rotation, seed saving, slash and burn, or other techniques to maximize efficiency while meeting the needs of the household or community. Historically, one subsisting in this way may have been known as a peasant.
