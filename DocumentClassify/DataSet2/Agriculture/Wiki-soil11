Soil temperature is important for the survival and early growth of seedlings. Soil temperatures affect the anatomical and morphological character of root systems.[103] All physical, chemical, and biological processes in soil and roots are affected in particular because of the increased viscosities of water and protoplasm at low temperatures. In general, climates that do not preclude survival and growth of white spruce above ground are sufficiently benign to provide soil temperatures able to maintain white spruce root systems. In some northwestern parts of the range, white spruce occurs on permafrost sites[104] and although young unlignified roots of conifers may have little resistance to freezing,[105] less than half of the "secondary mature" root system of white spruce was killed by exposure to a temperature of 23.3 °C in multiple year experiment with containerized trees from local nurseries in Massachusetts.[106]
