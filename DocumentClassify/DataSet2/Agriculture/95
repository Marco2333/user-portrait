Scottish Borders Council considers Brexit response team
Scottish Borders Council is to consider setting up a Brexit response team to monitor the impact on the region.
The main implications for the area of the UK's exit from the European Union are highlighted in a report to the local authority.
It said economic development funding, agriculture and access to the single market were among the areas of concern.
The implications for about 3,500 EU nationals in the region could also be monitored if the team is created.
The council's executive committee is being asked to agree to the move so it can "effectively monitor and respond most effectively" to any changes as a result of the UK leaving the EU.
The team would have a representative from each of its main service areas likely to be affected by Brexit.
Initially this would include economic development, finance, regulatory services, procurement, human resources and the legal department.
