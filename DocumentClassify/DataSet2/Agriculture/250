Jersey agriculture industry sees wage drop by 3.1%
Jersey's agriculture industry is the only sector in the island to see wages fall over the past year.
Figures released by the States of Jersey show average wages have risen in all industries except farming.
The figures also showed that, despite an increase across most sectors, the rise in weekly average earnings were not in line with the cost of living. 
The retail and wholesale sectors saw the biggest increases but wages in agricultural dropped by 3.1%.
The President of the Jersey Farmers Union, Graham Le Lay, said agriculture often faced extra challenges. 
He said: "There really hasn't been a cut, what has happened over the last two or three years is that many high earners in the industry are no longer employed.
"That has come about largely because of the glass house industry going into decline. Previously there were at least 30 tomato growers and flower nurseries supplying UK supermarkets."
The average weekly earnings of workers in the island has risen by 1.5% in the past year but the cost of living increase was 3%. This is the third year in a row wages have risen at a lower rate than inflation.
The figures showed the average weekly salary was Â£650.
