FoI law to cover all government departments and Chief Constable
Tynwald has voted to extend the government's Freedom of Information (FoI) legislation.
The legislation was first introduced in February but only applied to the Cabinet Office and the Department of the Environment, Food and Agriculture.
It will be extended to all departments, the Chief Constable and the Clerk of Tynwald from 1 January 2017.
The motion was brought before Tynwald by the Policy and Reform Minister Chris Thomas. 
They have included prison figures, planning applications and the Manx Electric Railway. 
Mr Thomas said there has undoubtedly been an impact on the two current departments but neither had suffered operationally.
He told Tynwald: "Freedom of Information is a key part of an open and transparent government and this will be a further milestone in the development of our democracy on the Isle of Man.
"I hope it will reinforce public trust and confidence."
Mr Thomas said the FoI law will be rolled out across all local authorities and statutory boards on the island by 2018.
The legislation is designed to give members of the public the right to access information which is held by public authorities.
