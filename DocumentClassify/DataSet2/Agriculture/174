Agricultural company Riverlea to close Crymych depot
An agricultural company has confirmed it will be closing one of its depots in Pembrokeshire.
Riverlea has been trading in Crymych for more than 50 years. Up to 20 staff will be offered posts in Whitland.  
Local councillor John Davies has described the decision as a "major blow".
Riverlea has other depots in Whitland, Carmarthenshire and Llandow in Vale of Glamorgan.
