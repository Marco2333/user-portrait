Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill to visit China
The agriculture minister is to return to China next month as attempts to access markets there continue. 
Michelle O'Neill hosted a departmental breakfast at the Balmoral Show on Thursday morning. 
In attendance was the Chinese consul general Madam Wang Shuying.  
Chinese inspectors visited Northern Ireland pork plants in April as part of a process to approve local pork for export. 
Ms O'Neill said she was also hoping to agree access to Chinese markets for beef and chicken. 
US consul general Greg Burton was also at the event. 
Northern Ireland is hoping to sell beef into the United States. 
Ms O'Neill said she was also working with Irish agriculture minister Simon Coveney to resolve labelling issues that have hit Northern Ireland lamb sales to meat plants in the Republic of Ireland. 
She told guests that the quality of Northern Ireland food was "something that carries our reputation around the world."
She said it was "safe, traceable and sustainably produced" and she would seek to use that reputation to open doors. 
It is the second day of the Balmoral Show, the biggest showcase for Northern Ireland's farming and food industries.
