Vanuatu country profile
Vanuatu - a string of more than 80 islands once known as the New Hebrides - achieved independence from France and Britain in 1980. 
Most of the islands are inhabited; some have active volcanoes.
Vanuatu is mountainous and much of it is covered with tropical rainforests. Like most of the area, it is prone to earthquakes and tidal waves. In 2015 it was hit by Cyclone Pam which caused widespread damage.
Most of the people live in rural areas and practise subsistence agriculture.
Local traditions are strong. Women, for example, generally have lower social standing than men and have fewer educational opportunities.
The island of Pentecost is home to land diving, a precursor to bungee jumping, which is still practised.
President: Baldwin Lonsdale
Baldwin Lonsdale was chosen as president by Vanuatu's electoral college - comprising the 52 members of parliament and the heads of the six provincial governments - in September 2014.
He succeeded Iolu Abil when his five-year term in office expired.
He is a former senior civil servant and served as the secretary general of the Torba provincial government before becoming an Anglican priest. 
The single TV channel on Vanuatu was established with the help of Radio France Overseas (RFO) and broadcasts in French and English.
