In the 18th century, for example, Methodism grew out of Anglican minister John Wesley's evangelical and revival movement.[302] Several Pentecostal and non-denominational churches, which emphasize the cleansing power of the Holy Spirit, in turn grew out of Methodism.[303] Because Methodists, Pentecostals, and other evangelicals stress "accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior",[304] which comes from Wesley's emphasis of the New Birth,[305] they often refer to themselves as being born-again.[306][307]
