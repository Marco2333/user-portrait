Also, other human rights were advocated for by some Protestants. For example, torture was abolished in Prussia in 1740, slavery in Britain in 1834 and in the United States in 1865 (William Wilberforce, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Abraham Lincoln â€“ against Southern Protestants).[177][178] Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf were among the first thinkers who made significant contributions to international law.[179][180] The Geneva Convention, an important part of humanitarian international law, was largely the work of Henry Dunant, a reformed pietist. He also founded the Red Cross.[181]
