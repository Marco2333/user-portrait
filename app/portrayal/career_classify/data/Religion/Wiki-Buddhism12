Historically, the roots of Buddhism lie in the religious thought of Iron Age India around the middle of the first millennium BCE.[340] That was a period, states Abraham Eraly, of great intellectual ferment, when the Upanishads were composed marking a change in the historical Vedic religion, as well as the emergence of great Sramanic traditions.[341] According to Richard Gombrich, this was not only a period of intellectual ferment but also socio-cultural change quite distinct from the early Vedic period.[342][note 36]
