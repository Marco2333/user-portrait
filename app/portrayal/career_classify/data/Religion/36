North Yorkshire police to treat misogyny as hate crime
Unwanted sexual advances and verbal abuse against women will be recorded as a hate crime by North Yorkshire Police.
The misogyny crackdown was announced on International Women's Day by Deputy Chief Constable Lisa Winward.
The Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality and women's rights, said it was "delighted" by the news.
Supt Mark Khan, North Yorkshire's lead officer for hate crime, said the initiative was in response to concerns raised by women on a youth commission panel.
"Some of the young women said they felt vulnerable in public areas and subjected to harassment," he said.
"We hope the outcome is that women feel we are taking these crimes seriously and lead more women to come forward."
He denied the force was trying to outlaw harmless banter and was being "politically correct".
"If you say it is... 'locker room banter'...I think you are trivialising it. If you think it's that, then you don't understand what misogyny is," Supt Khan added.
Police forces in England and Wales are required to record incidents where a crime against a person is motivated by hostility or prejudice towards the victim's race or nationality, disability, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity.
"We need to call out misogyny for what it is - a hate crime," Sam Smethers from the Fawcett Society said.
"Women and girls face a tidal wave of abuse and harassment every day. Our law has to send a clear signal [it] is not acceptable."
