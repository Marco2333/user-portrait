Despite periodic repression, the Brotherhood has become one of the most influential movements in the Islamic world,[141] particularly in the Arab world. For many years it was described as "semi-legal"[142] and was the only opposition group in Egypt able to field candidates during elections.[143] In the Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011–2012, the political parties identified as "Islamist" (the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, Salafi Al-Nour Party and liberal Islamist Al-Wasat Party) won 75% of the total seats.[144] Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist of Muslim Brotherhood, was the first democratically elected president of Egypt. He was deposed during the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état.
