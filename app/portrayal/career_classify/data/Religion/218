Isle of Man Equality Bill could be in force by summer 2017
The Isle of Man's Equality Act could be in force by next summer, according to the Manx government.
The legislation would make it illegal to discriminate on the grounds of age, disability, gender, race, religion and sexual orientation.
Policy and Reform Minister Chris Thomas said it will "address issues such as equal pay rights for men and women". 
The government said the differences could be down to a range of "complex reasons not necessarily related to any direct discrimination against women".
In addition, successful claims arising on the Isle of Man will not be as much as those which are paid out in the UK.
Mr Thomas said the new rules will apply to the public, private and third sector.
"On the face of it, we could see a rise in equal pay claims under the bill," he said. 
"There have been a number of long running and costly cases in the UK in this area - particularly in the public sector - however that should not be like this on the island."
According to Mr Thomas the maximum of pay arrears that the tribunal can award will be two years rather than the six-year period in the UK.
He added: "Finally it will not be possible in a successful [work of equal value] case for pay arrears to be awarded for any period prior to the date on which the new provisions come into operation.
"That is two years after Royal Assent."
