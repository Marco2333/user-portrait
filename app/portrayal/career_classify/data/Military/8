Welsh shires to be Middle East military parade horses
Two Welsh shire horses are leaving Pembrokeshire for a life as military parade horses in the Middle East.
JR was born at Dyfed Shire Horse Farm in Eglwyswrw in 2007 and Joe was born at Tywyn's Caerberllan stud and raised by the Bodsworth family near Llandysul.
Both have been firm favourites at the Eglwyswrw farm but are now embarking on a new life as military drum horses. 
They have been bought by a mystery buyer from the Middle East for use in huge military parades.
JR's brother, Celt, already serves with the Household Cavalry in London.
Mark Cole from Dyfed Shire Horse Farm admitted there were mixed emotions about their departure.
He described them as "proper characters beloved by the visitors", but said it was also a day of "great pride".
