Firearms seized at Lincolnshire firing range
Police have seized firearms from a firing range and explosives storage facility in Lincolnshire. 
The operation is being carried out at Skydock, which is at the former RAF Faldingworth base near Market Rasen. 
Lincolnshire Police said its own officers were working with military firearms experts after the Home Office withdrew a licence to store weapons.
When contacted by the BBC, the company declined to comment on the operation which began on Monday. 
Deputy Chief Constable Gary Knighton said there was a significant amount of work to do on the site. 
"Following the revocation of the S5 Licence by the Home Office, we are seizing the weapons subject to the revocation to maintain their security and ensure public safety," he said. 
Police said the operation would take a number of days to complete. 
No arrests have been made. 
Weapons covered by the S5 license include those not typically permitted for civilian use, such as automatic firearms, hand guns, missiles, rockets and noxious gases. 
Skydock is a facility which offers ballistic testing, pyrotechnics development, high security and bomb-proof storage.
Standing within a 1,000-acre site, it has a 250m steel and concrete firing range, outdoor testing areas and indoor testing laboratories.
According to its website, special effects TV and film crews frequently use the facilities to film specialist projects.
