Nottingham Asda worker jailed over terror offences
A former Asda worker has been jailed for eight years for trying to join Islamist extremists in the Philippines.
Ryan Counsell, 28, a Muslim convert from Nottingham, was convicted of four charges, including having possession of an al-Qaeda bomb-making guide.
Woolwich Crown Court heard he was arrested two days before he was due to fly out.
Judge Andrew Lees said: "I'm sure you would have gone, and I'm sure you would not have returned."
Counsell's barrister claimed he had intended to leave his home in Russell Road, Forest Fields, because the Brexit result had prompted an anti-Muslim backlash.
He added the idea of Counsell joining the Abu Sayyaf group, which is linked to the so-called Islamic State, was "absurd" as it did not recruit westerners but kidnapped them instead.
But the judge said he had downloaded "a wealth" of extremist material and hidden Â£900 worth of military-style equipment and clothing in his child's bedroom.
