Roman military camp discovered in Burley-in-Wharfedale
A "nationally important" Roman camp has been discovered on the site of a proposed housing development.
Surveyors found remnants of the site while preparing plans for 500 homes at Burley-in-Wharfedale, West Yorkshire.
Neil Redfern, from Historic England, said the camp had "a great story to tell" about the Roman invasion in that part of the country.
Property developer CEG said it planned to incorporate the camp as a feature in the development.
The company has submitted a planning application to build the new homes, as well as a primary school, parks and open spaces and improvements to public transport.
However, the plans have prompted objections from local residents who oppose the development of greenbelt land. 
Some objections also said the proposal should not go ahead because of the discovery of the Roman camp.
One local resident said: "The discovery of Roman camp remains in the very centre of the site means that the land and site are of historical significance. 
"This heritage is fragile and easily lost, particularly for undiscovered underground finds such as this, which should be conserved for our and future generations."
However, the company said it wanted to make the camp an "education and historic feature within the proposal, providing considerable public benefit".
Mr Redfern, principal inspector of ancient monuments for Yorkshire at Historical England, said the camp acted "as an enormous catalyst to ask questions".
"It's a new bit of knowledge, new part of the story, to help us understand how and when the Romans came around and how they interacted with the country and the landscape.
"It is important nationally as well as locally. It is really a great thing to identify the people, it's a great story to tell."
The planning application is due to be considered by Bradford Council by 17 January.
