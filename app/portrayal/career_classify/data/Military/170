Convicted stalker Kenneth Ward agrees to stay away
A man who harassed his neighbour for years has agreed not to return to his home.
After his release a sexual offences prevention order was imposed making it impossible for him to return to his home at Chop Gate in North Yorkshire.
The Appeal Court was told he had changed his mind and no longer wished to appeal the order.
His barrister, Michael Cahill, told the court: "He effectively cannot afford now the property in Chop Gate.
"He is going to surrender the tenancy on the cottage. The cottage is effectively now in ruin, having been left there for five years."
In 2015, Teesside Crown Court was told Ward had repeatedly exposed himself over several years.
In one episode, he had walked naked on to his victim's property and committed a sex act while watching her through binoculars.
When police went to investigate, they found military memorabilia, including firearms unlawfully held.
His victim Mandy Dunford, of Chop Gate, North Yorkshire, a former police officer, had said she would be forced to move if he was allowed to return to his home.
Ward's cottage was just 175m (574ft) away from Ms Dunford's smallholding.
The court imposed the order, which included a five mile exclusion zone, to protect her from bumping into him.
Mr Cahill told the court Ward had been offered a new home in Faldingworth Base, in Lincolnshire, by a friend.
He said: "He has come to the realisation that, for both parties, it is best if there's some distance between each other."
He was also ordered to wear an electronic tag for ten years but three appeal court judges cut that to two years.
