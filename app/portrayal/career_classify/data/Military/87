Slough policeman Simon Edwards fired over military lies
A police officer who lied about his military service has been dismissed.
A misconduct hearing was told PC Simon Edwards had boasted to colleagues about having experience in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland. 
He also lied about being in the Parachute Regiment and Red Devils parachute display team.
Thames Valley Police said Mr Edwards had been dismissed for gross misconduct and his behaviour "fell far short" of police standards.
Mr Edwards, who worked at Slough police station, was found to have breached conduct regulations over "honesty and integrity and authority, respect and courtesy".
In April 2014 he attended a commendation presentation ceremony with the chief constable, during which he sported Iraq, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and Macedonia campaign medals that he was not entitled to wear.
The misconduct hearing was also told he had constructed a false account about an incident in which a police car triggered a speed camera.
Det Ch Supt Tim De Meyer said: "If people are to have trust and confidence in the police then our officers must demonstrate exemplary standards of honesty and integrity. 
"PC Edwards's conduct fell far short of these standards and was an affront to members of the armed forces and to police colleagues.
"His misconduct was reported by his fellow officers which shows that such behaviour is not tolerated in Thames Valley Police."
