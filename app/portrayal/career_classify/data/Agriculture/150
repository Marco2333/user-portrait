Shellfish industry: Minister 'working on' Irish court ruling
The Irish agriculture minister is preparing legislation to tackle a legal row that could cost Northern Ireland's mussel fishermen Â£300,000.
It cast doubt over "lucrative" access for Northern Ireland-registered boats to waters off the Irish Republic.
Fishermen had said banning them would be "catastrophic" for the industry.
Northern Ireland fishermen collect baby mussels which are then re-laid and matured in Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough.
The ruling was made after a number of fishermen in the Irish Republic had taken the Supreme Court case claiming too much seed was being taken.
Stormont's Agriculture Minister Michelle McIlveen told the assembly that her Irish counterpart Michael Creed, was preparing legislation to regularise the situation.
The long-standing agreement had been based on a "gentleman's agreement" reached between civil servants on both sides of the border in the 1960s.
The Supreme Court found that as seed mussel was a national resource, rules around its use required a law passed in the Irish parliament.
Ms McIlveen said that was now being worked on and was important to the local fleet as it was a "lucrative" opportunity.
She told the assembly the once the legislation was drafted it was hoped that it could pass through all its stages in the new year.
"I'm hopeful that that will then correct this particular issue," she said.
It was thought the ruling could affect around 10 companies in Northern Ireland.
