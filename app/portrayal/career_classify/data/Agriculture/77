Bird flu: New case confirmed in County Tipperary
A sixth case of bird flu in a wild bird in the Republic of Ireland since last year has been confirmed in County Tipperary.
The latest case involved a whooper swan found in Nenagh. 
It follows three previous cases in whooper swans this year, with two cases in Eurasian wigeons in December.
In December, the Irish Department of Agriculture activated regulations requiring all poultry and captive birds to be kept within a secure building amid concerns over bird flu.
The public is advised not to handle dead or sick birds.
Avian influenza is a contagious disease that affects birds, including poultry: It can spread quickly, often proving fatal.
It can occur in both wild and farmed birds, but the threat to the public is said to be very low.
