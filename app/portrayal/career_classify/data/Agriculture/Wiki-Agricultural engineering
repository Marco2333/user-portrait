Agricultural engineering in forestry


Agricultural engineers may engage in any of the following areas:
The first curriculum in agricultural engineering was established at Iowa State University by Professor J. B. Davidson in 1903. The American Society of Agricultural Engineers, now known as the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers, was founded in 1907.[1]
Agricultural engineers may perform tasks such as planning, supervising and managing the building of dairy effluent schemes, irrigation, drainage, flood water control systems, performing environmental impact assessments, agricultural product processing and interpret research results and implement relevant practices. A large percentage of agricultural engineers work in academia or for government agencies such as the United States Department of Agriculture or state agricultural extension services. Some are consultants, employed by private engineering firms, while others work in industry, for manufacturers of agricultural machinery, equipment, processing technology, and structures for housing livestock and storing crops. Agricultural engineers work in production, sales, management, research and development, or applied science.
In the United Kingdom the term Agricultural Engineer is often also used to describe a person that repairs or modifies agricultural equipment.
