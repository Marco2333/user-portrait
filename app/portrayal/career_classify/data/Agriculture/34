Prince Charles meets Ribble Valley food producers
The Prince of Wales dodged a hailstorm as he stepped off the train to visit Lancashire food producers.
Prince Charles sampled food and drink including a Duke of Lancaster's Regiment sausage and Hen Harrier golden ale as he toured the Ribble Valley.
Hundreds of people lined Clitheroe town centre to meet the prince who was treated to a preview of produce for this summer's popular food festival.
"There are some very brave people standing out in Clitheroe," he said.
Prince Charles met local food producers and traders who showcased their goods during a promotional event for Clitheroe Food Festival, which attracts thousands of people from across the UK.
The heir to the throne was offered a leek and black pudding sausage and also a marmalade one, which he did not appear keen on, at Cowman's Famous Sausage Shop.
He settled on the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment sausage and said: "I think I will have another of those," quipping: "It's not even lunchtime."
The final engagement of the day in Lancashire was to family-run Dewlay Cheesemakers of Garstang.
As patron of the Specialist Cheesemakers Association, he was given a tour of the dairy and also met the firm's local suppliers, as well as agricultural students from nearby Myerscough College.
Cheesemaker Nick Kenyon said: "Today is an incredible honour. It makes you feel proud and privileged to have had the opportunity to have met him."
The visit was commemorated by Prince Charles unveiling a plaque outside the premises of the firm, which is in its 60th year of business.
