Prince Harry visits Leicester Aids charity
Prince Harry has followed in the footsteps of his mother by visiting an Aids support charity during a visit to Leicester.
He met staff at Leicestershire Aids Support Service (LASS), which Diana, Princess of Wales, visited in 1991.
After taking part in workshops, he unveiled a commemorative plaque to mark the project's 30th birthday. 
Harry also went to the Yes You Can and the Pink Lizard youth projects while in the city
LASS provides information and advocacy for people living with or affected by HIV, and also works with others on tackling the stigma and discrimination faced daily by those living with HIV.
Harry discussed the support centre's work with volunteer Amdani Juma.
Mr Juma, from Nottingham, said of the prince's visit: "It is very important because he is someone who is really aware.
"He can bring the message and the breakthrough to where we cannot reach. Princess Diana was here in 1991 and to have Harry visit is very special, it's very emotional."
The prince also visited Hamilton Community College to hear about its Yes You Can personal development project.
It aims to help under-performing Year 8 pupils to reach their full potential.
He took part in work at the Pink Lizard organisation which use sport as a way to help young people build their confidence, tackle negative behaviour and get youngsters from deprived communities into education, training and employment.
