She said: "Newby Wiske Hall and its grounds are beautiful - but as a listed former stately home in a relatively remote rural location, it's not what's needed in this day and age and is expensive to run. 
"There is, of course, some sadness to be leaving our home of some 40 years, but our new HQ in central Northallerton will save money over the longer term and help us modernise the way we work, ultimately improving the service to our communities."
PGL plans to turn the building and grounds into a centre providing educational activity courses for schools and young people, creating about 100 jobs.
