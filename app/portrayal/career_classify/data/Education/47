Sandbach school funding protest by parents
Hundreds of parents have taken part in a protest march against what they claim are "unfair" school funding plans. 
The march started at Sandbach School on Crewe Road at 11:00 and ended at Sandbach Cobbles in the town centre.
Organiser Laura Smith said the march allowed Cheshire parents to show their anger at changes they claim will leave their children worse off. 
The national funding formula proposals would reduce spending per pupil in Cheshire East to just under £4,200, which is among the lowest in the country. 
In the London borough of Westminster schools will receive almost £6,000 per pupil. 
One parent of a pupil at Vernon Primary School in Poynton said: "We're protesting against education funding cuts and the proposed national funding formula which is anything but fair."
Heva Simpson said it was "wonderful to see parents coming together to make sure our voice is heard".
Education Secretary Justine Greening said schools were already receiving record levels of funding.
She told MPs she accepted there were "cost pressures" but that schools had "significant scope for efficiencies".
The Department for Education has said the current system for distributing funds across the country is "unfair" and the new plans will see more than half of England's schools receive a cash boost.
