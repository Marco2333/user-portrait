Guernsey health and education sites going smoke-free
Smoking at health and education facilities on Guernsey has been banned from today.
Currently smoking on such sites is allowed in designated areas or shelters, which will be removed.
The ban includes all sites owned or managed by the two departments, including car parks.
The move is part of the Guernsey and Alderney Tobacco Control Strategy which aims to reduce the impact of smoking.
Medical Officer of Health Dr Stephen Bridgman said: "It's known from other places that this does encourage people to give up smoking.
"Its an important step for the States to take."
