Earlston education centre plans seek progress
Approval is being sought to start consultation on plans for an additional support centre for pupils with profound and complex needs in the Borders.
The site in Earlston is scheduled to open in 2017.
Scottish Borders Council said early indications were that community views of the project were "very positive".
It is now seeking approval to start formal consultation on the move which would also end current provision at primaries in Hawick and Innerleithen.
The council has said the new building will provide a "first class learning environment for children with complex and profound needs from across the Borders".
