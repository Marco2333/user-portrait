The concept of 'education through recreation' was applied to childhood development in the 19th century.[22] In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities.[23] L.P. Jacks, also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: "A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well."[24] Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities.[25] The concept has been revived by the University of Western Ontario to teach anatomy to medical students.[25]
