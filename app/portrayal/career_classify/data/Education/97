TV listings: The battle over your programme guide
Viewers may have trouble finding shows they love if public service channels are not guaranteed top positions on TV guides, major broadcasters have warned.
Peers are currently debating a change to the law which says channels including BBC One, ITV and Channel 4 must appear top of on-screen listings.
Major broadcasters argue public service channels should be protected as people adopt more personalised viewing habits.
But Sky says the networks are acting in "blatant self-interest".
The House of Lords is debating whether there should be an amendment to the Digital Economy Bill, to protect the place of public service broadcasters (PSBs).
Mr Purnell said: "Some pay-TV platforms are already making 'free to air' services harder to find. There's no point being top of the programme guide if it's difficult to find the guide.
"This isn't about forcing people to watch public service programmes, or stopping viewers watching American shows we love. It's about making sure you can find them easily."
He also points out that in channel listings on Sky, the BBC's children's channels, CBeebies and CBBC - which he describes as "safe, trusted, educational, British programmes without adverts" - are below a dozen US cartoon networks.
The Sky statement continued: "On Sky Q, for example, they will not allow us to promote their shows on our home page. And on the SkyGo and Sky Q mobile app, the BBC has refused to grant Sky the rights to show any content whatsoever.
"The BBC needs to get with the times and allow consumers to view content they have already paid for alongside the content of other PSBs and commercial broadcasters."
The government argues that viewers are getting more choice over what appears on their own homepages - and protecting PSBs would be anti-competitive.
