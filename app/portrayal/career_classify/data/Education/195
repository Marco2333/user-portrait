Jobs 'in danger' as Anglesey school cleaner budget halved
Anglesey's school cleaning budget has been halved, putting about 150 jobs in danger, union officials have said.
GMB said the decision by Anglesey council would "devastate" the incomes of dozens of cleaners with the "likely exodus" of many workers.
The union has called for a formal consultation into the decision and said cleaners plan to "fight the cuts".
Anglesey council said "no service can escape efficiency cuts".
GMB regional organiser for north Wales, Mark Jones, said: "The announcement went far beyond our worst expectations. 
"Such cuts are unworkable with the likelihood of significant falls in cleaning standards. 
"The reduced hours will mean the jobs will not be worth doing."
A council spokesman said it would "work closely with schools to ensure cleanliness standards are maintained". 
He added: "Unfortunately, the financial challenges facing local government have reached a point where no service can escape efficiency cuts. 
"Anglesey's budget for 2017-18 was recently approved and ensured that education funding for our children and young people is protected for another year. 
"Nevertheless, cuts to non-teaching costs are still required, with a decision taken to reduce cleaning services so pupils' education continues to be protected."
