"While past nominees for Secretary of Education have served as teachers, school system leaders, and governors, and came to the Department of Education with deep executive experience in public education, you have held no such position. As such, your nomination provides the Senate and the public with few clues about your actual policy positions on a host of critical issues."RELATED: Democrats target 8 Cabinet nominees, threaten to drag out processWhen asked for response to Warren's letter, Trump transition team responded with a statement: "The Secretary designate is looking forward to her confirmation hearing on Wednesday and responding to questions from all members on the Senate HELP committee."
