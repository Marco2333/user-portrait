Plaque unveiled to Discworld author Sir Terry Pratchett
A plaque honouring Sir Terry Pratchett has been unveiled at the library he credited with his "education".
The Discworld author was a Saturday boy at the site in Beaconsfield, where he borrowed and read countless books.
Fans of the writer came from as far as Leeds and Swansea dressed as their favourite characters from his novels.
His daughter, Rhianna, said the plaque - commissioned by the town council - was a "perfect tribute" to her late father.
She added: "Terry Pratchett the author was born at Beaconsfield Library."
Sir Terry, who sold 85 million books worldwide, died in 2015 from Alzheimer's disease, aged 66.
Councillor Philip Bastiman said it was "only right" there was a permanent tribute to the author in his Buckinghamshire hometown.
