Shortage of 'suitable candidates' to replace Education Authority chief
The Education Authority (EA) has halted the recruitment of a new chief executive to succeed Gavin Boyd.
The EA manages about £1.6bn of the education budget, and delivers school transport, meals and support for special educational needs.
Mr Boyd has headed the EA since it came into being in April 2015, on a total salary package of about £200,000 per year.
He was expected to step down by the end of 2016.
However, the EA say they have not found enough suitable candidates to succeed him.
In a statement, the authority said that it would not proceed with the current recruitment process.
"The selection panel took the view that there was potentially an insufficient number of candidates whose applications demonstrated the standards required for this very demanding role," it said.
"All aspects of the ongoing selection process for the post of chief executive will be reviewed before proceeding any further.
"It is anticipated that the EA chief executive post will be re-advertised once the review of the selection process is compete."
As a result, Mr Boyd is expected to stay in post for the immediate future.
The authority replaced the five education and library boards in April 2015.
