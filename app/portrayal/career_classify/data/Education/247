Catalan ex-leader Artur Mas banned from office over illegal referendum
Former Catalan leader Artur Mas has been banned from holding office for two years after organising an illegal independence referendum in 2014.
The 61-year-old was convicted in Catalonia's Superior Court of Justice of civil disobedience for organising the symbolic, non-binding poll.
Spain's Constitutional Court had banned the vote at the time. 
Catalonia, a region in the country's north-east, has long campaigned for greater autonomy.
The pro-independence Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) party called the verdict "disgraceful" and "undemocratic".
Mr Mas said: "We will appeal in Spain and then take the case to European courts, if we need to."
The Catalonia court also fined Mr Mas, who was president of Catalonia from 2010 until last year, €36,500 (£32,000; $39,000).
Two former members of his government - his deputy Joana Ortega and education minister Irene Riga - were also found guilty and banned from public office for 21 and 18 months respectively. They were also fined.
Many waved the Catalan pro-independence flag, chanting "you are not alone", "democracy is not a crime" and "independence".
The current Catalonia government has vowed to hold a new vote in September.
Catalan officials say more than 80% of those who voted in its 9 November 2014 poll backed independence. 
However, only 2.3 million voters, out of an estimated 5.4 million who were eligible, took part.
